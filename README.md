# PythonGameDice
Basic Python D&amp;D dice roller with GUI (learner project)

This project will use Python to generate random numbers for x number (1-X) dice of varying types, 
specifically 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, & 100 sided dice as used in the D&D RPG.

This README file will be updated with documentation as I build the program.
